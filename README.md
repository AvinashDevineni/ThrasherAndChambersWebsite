# Getting Code
To get the code from this repository (a place where the code is stored), run `git clone https://github.com/AvinashDevineni/ThrasherAndChambersWebsite/` and then `git remote add upstream https://github.com/AvinashDevineni/ThrasherAndChambersWebsite/`.
Then, open VSCode in the newly created folder (should be called ThrasherAndChambersWebsite) and this is where all the code is

# Running Code

# Uploading Code
To upload your code, you need to have Git installed. If you do, run `git add .`, then `git commit -m "ENTER YOUR MESSAGE IN HERE. DESCRIBE WHAT CHANGES YOU MADE"`, and finally `git push`. Now, your code is uploaded to your copy of the ThrasherAndChambersWebsite repository but not the actual one, so you need to make a merge request.
- Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
- You should see a banner with a button saying "Compare & pull request". Click it.
- Choose the base repository as AvinashDevineni/ThrasherAndChambersWebsite and the branch as main.
- Select the compare branch as main.
Now, add a brief title and description and submit the pull request.
